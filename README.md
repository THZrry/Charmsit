# Charmsit
Charmsbar is an interesting tool in Win8.
I want to bring it back to Win11 or other systems,even unix-like systems!
but my computer is too weak to test it in other systems,so it may not work properly in other systems.

# Code
it is writen in python 3.6.6 and tkinter tcl8.6
maybe it's not as good as charmsbar win win8, but i tried to make it better :)
now, it supports non-linar animation and multi-language
the project is just for fun, so i can't promise to make it perfect.
